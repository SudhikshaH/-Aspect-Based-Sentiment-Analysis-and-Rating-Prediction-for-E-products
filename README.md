## `Project Title`: ReviewLens - Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis and Rating Prediction Dashboard for E-Commerce Products

## Project Description
ReviewLens is a smart dashboard solution that analyzes e-commerce product reviews to extract actionable insights. It uses **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis** to break down customer reviews into product-specific components (like battery, sound quality, cooling, etc.) and evaluates each for positive and negative sentiment. The goal is to help product teams, analysts, or marketers understand what works and what doesnâ€™t for each product â€” providing guidance on how to improve and enhance user satisfaction. The dashboard also supports real-time updates, benchmarking comparisons, and predictive analytics for overall rating improvement strategies.

## Features
- Choose a product and see all associated aspect-level sentiments
- Donut charts showing Positive vs Negative % for each aspect
- Predictive rating v/s Actual Rating
- Wordclouds for most frequent positive/negative phrases
- Fully interactive Streamlit dashboard
